Contents of this repository:

	* Qt GUI project:
	
		Used to build 2D maps (matrix of nodes), and to visualize the states of the A* algorithm until the final optimal 
		path has been created.
		
		In order to compile the GUI application, you'll have to, first, install the Qt Creator 2.7.1 or later (based on 
		Qt 4.8.4 32-bit framework), second, clone this entire repository or pull the updates, third, open the project 
		using the downloaded editor, and finally, compile the application within the Qt Creator environment.
